# LOTRConverter

--- 
iOS app developed in Swift as part of Kenneth Jones's course.

I recently started learning Swift, and this project represents one of my first hands-on experiences building an iOS application.

It was developed using key Swift and SwiftUI features, including:

- SwiftUI Views and Modifiers for building responsive user interfaces
- @State and @Binding for reactive data handling
- Stacks, Text, Image, and TextField for layout and content presentation
- Functions, If/Else, Loops, and Enums to manage logic and behavior
- Support for Dark Mode and custom App Icon integration
- A model-view structure for better code organization
